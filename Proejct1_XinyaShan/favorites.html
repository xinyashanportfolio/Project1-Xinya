    <li>Stardew valley - my favorite way to spend a cozy afternoon</li>
    <li>Favorite Stardew character: Sebastian</li>
<P>Stardew Valley is a farming and life-simulation game where you move to a small town to restore your grandfathers old farm.
     You grow crops, raise animals, mine for resources, build relationships with villagers, and help revive the community. The game focuses on relaxation, creativity, and choosing your own pace of life.

Sebastian is my favorite character because he feels real and relatable. He is quiet, thoughtful, 
and independent, preferring coding, music, and late-night motorcycle rides over crowded social life. As you get to know him, he opens up in a sincere and loyal way, which makes his storyline feel meaningful and personal.</P>
